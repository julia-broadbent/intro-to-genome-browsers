## Workshop overview

This tutorial will introduce you to the genome browser format and illustrate how some freely available genome browsers can be used to interrogate a variety of data types, such as gene expression, genomic variation, methylation and many more.

### Learning objectives

At the end of this introductory workshop, you will:

-   Understand the how some types of genomics and expression data are represented in Genome browsers.
-   Understand gene models and identify differences between transcripts variants.
-   Determine the tissue/cell type expression profiles of a gene of interest in mouse and human expression data.
-   Know some basic files types used in Genome browsers and upload and view local BAM files.
-   Use the ‘Blat’ tool to locate genomic regions with similarity to a sequence of interest.
-   Create custom interactive views with multiple datatypes to share with colleagues and generate images for publications.

### Description

By focusing on gene expression, this hands on tutorial will provide beginners with an introduction to both the **UCSC Genome browser** and **IGV (Integrated Genome Viewer)**. 

Tools and public datasets will be used to illustrate how the expression of transcript variants can be investigated in different tissues and cell types using public data, including human RNAseq data from [GTEX](https://gtexportal.org/home/) and mouse cell type RNAseq data from [Tabula Muris](https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org/), as viewed within the UCSC genome browser. A subset of Single cell RNAseq data from the [Allen Brain Atlas Celltax](http://casestudies.brain-map.org/celltax) study will also be downloaded from [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and visualised in IGV. 

The data and genes used in this workshop are taken from the neuroscience field, however the analysis approaches and tools illustrated can be applied to many research areas.

###

### Timing

The anticipated workshop duration when delivered to a group of participants is **4 hours**. Note that not all the exercises are expected to be completed during the workshop.

###

### Skill level

This workshop is designed for participants with **no previous experience** of using Genome Browsers and **no programming experience**.
